Qalculate! GTK UI

Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator. It is simple
to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated
math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency
conversion and percent calculation). Features include a large library of
customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, symbolic calculations
(including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty
propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK, 
Qt, and CLI).

1. Requirements

* GTK (>= 3.10)
* libqalculate (>= 5.6.0)

2. Installation

Instructions and download links for installers, binaries packages, and the
source code of released versions of Qalculate! are available at
https://qalculate.github.io/downloads.html.

In a terminal window in the top source code directory run

* ./autogen.sh
  (not required if using a release source tarball, only if using the git
  version)
* ./configure
* make
* make install (as root, e.g. sudo make install)

If libqalculate has been installed in the default /usr/local path you it might
be necessary to specify the pkgconfig path when running configure using
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure

The resulting executable is named qalculate-gtk.
