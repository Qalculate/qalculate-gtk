                       Self-contained Qalculate! binaries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract (tar -xJf) and run from anywhere. The binaries are statically compiled
against libqalculate, icu, and mpfr, libcurl, openssl, readline, and termcap,
but requires that GTK (>= 3.10) is installed.

qalc - CLI application
qalculate - GUI application

Also includes an install script and an update script:
- Run install to install an icon and a desktop file.
- Run update, from a terminal window, to check if a new version is available and
update the binaries (qalc and qalculate). This can also be done from within
the GUI.

The source code and other binaries are available at https://qalculate.github.io
and the project page, https://github.com/Qalculate.
